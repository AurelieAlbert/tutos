# Data analysis software used in MEOM group and how to learn it.

authors : Julien Le Sommer and Aur√©lie Albert (MEOM group, IGE)

*This page provides a curated list of software used for data analysis in the MEOM group, online resources on how to use it and general advice on how to proceed with ocean data analysis. Please, keep in mind that (i) this list is not exhaustive and that (ii) it may evolve with time.*

## General advice

A nice mental picture for understanding most of our data analysis tasks is the **notion of data analysis pipeline**. Our data analyses generally combine several steps, all corresponding to individual pieces of software. Our data flows through the pipeline and gets transformed at each step by a particular piece of software. Ideally these pipelines shoud be as **automated** as possible so that our work is easily **reproducible**. 


A key principle for building data analysis pipelines is to try to **rely as much as possible on pre-existing software**. In practice, most of the steps in an analysis pipeline are very generic (as eg. reading/writing/plotting data) so that we can just use preexisting code. So a large fraction of our work just involves glueing together existing pieces of code. This is why modern software is now made as modular as possible. 

If you need to write new code, it should **focus in priority on what is specific** to your analysis. Some building-blocks of your data analysis pipeline are indeed more specific to your needs than others. For these key specific steps, you might have to write a dedicated module, but you should always first wonder if someone has already implemented something close to what you need. 

Knowing what is currently feasible with your sofware environment is therefore key for designing your own analyses. This requires your keeping **a routine curiosity for software**. In practice, this requires your spending time going through online videos and tutorials (because you learn better through examples). This also requires your being aware of minimal [good practices](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.00037) in scientific computing. 

In this page, you will find a **curated list of software**, tutorials and examples that we hope will improve your awareness of your technological environment. Do not hesitate to suggest new links and update to this page.


## Recommanded base configuration
To work with the MEOM group, you will need this minimal software configuration and set-up: 

 -  install [anaconda](https://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/) (python distribution and package manager)
 - install [git](https://git-scm.com/) (software version control manager)
 - create a [github](https://github.com/) account and learn how to use it : 
  - [cloning] (https://help.github.com/articles/importing-a-git-repository-using-the-command-line/) a repository
  - using [gist](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-gists/)
  - using [pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) (**advanced**)
  
 - (*to be updated*) ...

Caution : you may need to configure git to work through our network proxy.

## Jupyter notebooks
Jupyter notebooks are great for sharing your work because they allow to mix code, text and visualization in the same document. Because Jupyter notebooks can understand code in different languages, they are also great for building an complex data analysis pipelines.
**We therefore strongly recommend using Jupyter Notebooks**.

  * official [documentation](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)
  * using the [ipython](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ipython/ipython/blob/4.0.x/examples/IPython%20Kernel/Index.ipynb) kernel

### Data visualization with python :
There are currently too many libraries for visualizing data with python (see this [python data vizualization tour](https://dansaber.wordpress.com/2016/10/02/a-dramatic-tour-through-pythons-data-visualization-landscape-including-ggplot-and-altair/)), this may seem exciting or overwhelming depending on the point of view... In practice, you should distinguish libraries that focus on *interactive data visualization* (great for investigating your datasets in Jupyter notebooks) and libraries that focus on *static data visualization* (needed for writing papers and reports). Several of the more recent visualization libraries in python
implement concepts from the [*Grammar of graphics*](http://www.springer.com/us/book/9780387245447). 

  * **General purpose visualization:** 
 	 * *static visualization* : 
      * [matplotlib](http://www.matplotlib.org/) is the standard 2D and 3D plotting library for python. See this [tutorial](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/jrjohansson/scientific-python-lectures/blob/master/Lecture-4-Matplotlib.ipynb)
      * [seaborn](http://seaborn.pydata.org/) is a great to matplotlib for statistical data vizualisation with python (default plots look good with seaborn) : [tutorial](http://seaborn.pydata.org/tutorial.html), [examples](http://seaborn.pydata.org/examples/index.html), here is a nice [collection of ressources](https://community.modeanalytics.com/python/libraries/seaborn/)
      * [ggplot](http://ggplot.yhathq.com/) is a plotting system for Python based on R's ggplot2 and the Grammar of Graphics. see also this [video](www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHrwqLhAaMw)
      * [altair](https://github.com/ellisonbg/altair) is a new declarative statistical visualization library : [documentation](https://github.com/ellisonbg/altair), [tutorial notebook](https://github.com/ellisonbg/altair/blob/master/altair/notebooks/01-Index.ipynb)

    * *interactive vizualization (within Jupyter notebooks)*
      * [HoloViews](http://holoviews.org/)  lets you store your data in an annotated format that is instantly visualizable, with immediate access to both the numeric data and its visualization : [video demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jhUivliNSo), [video demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNsR2H7Lrg0), [example notebooks](https://github.com/ioam/holoviews-contrib)
      * [Bokeh](http://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/) is an interactive data visualization library that implements the grammar of graphics : [example gallery](http://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/docs/gallery.html#gallery), [notebook gallery](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/bokeh/bokeh-notebooks/blob/master/index.ipynb), [video demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9CgHHz_iYk) [](http://www.pyvideo.org/video/1224/bokeh-an-extensible-implementation-of-the-gramma)
      * [bqplot](https://github.com/bloomberg/bqplot) is a Grammar of Graphics-based interactive plotting framework for the Jupyter notebook. 
      * plotly is another interactive visualization library, probably more oriented to making charts and dashboard for companies: [documentation](https://plot.ly/python/offline/), [examples](https://plot.ly/python/)

  * **Visualizing geographical data** :
 	 * *static visualization* : 
      * [Basemap](http://matplotlib.org/basemap/) is an extension to matplotlib that allows to plot geographical data:  [documentation](https://basemaptutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
      * [Cartopy](http://scitools.org.uk/cartopy/) provides cartographic tools for python (developped by the MetOffice) : [documentation](http://scitools.org.uk/cartopy/docs/latest/index.html)

   * *interactive vizualization (within Jupyter notebooks)* :
      * [GeoViews](http://geo.holoviews.org/)  (*recommended*) is built on HoloViews. It allows to explore and visualize geographical  data interactively. Works nicely with xarray : [demo](https://www.continuum.io/blog/developer-blog/introducing-geoviews),  [examples](http://geo.holoviews.org/index.html)
